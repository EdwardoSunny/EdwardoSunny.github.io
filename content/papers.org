      <p class="paper-authors">Y Liang, G Zhang, <strong>Edward Sun</strong>, B Idnay, Y Fang, F Chen, C Ta, Y Peng, C Weng</p>
      <p class="paper-meta">Journal of Biomedical Informatics</p>
      <p class="paper-blurb">Propose a scalable LLM-based pipeline for automatically generating researcher interest profiles from PubMed, addressing the prevalence of outdated, incomplete, and inaccurately scraped online profiles that hinder expert discovery and collaboration. We compare MeSH-term–based generation with abstract-based summarization, introduce a TF-IDF–KL divergence metric to analyze semantic differences from human-written profiles, and show that despite low lexical overlap, semantic similarity is moderate. Human evaluations favor MeSH-based profiles for readability, demonstrating the feasibility of automated researcher profiling at scale.</p>
